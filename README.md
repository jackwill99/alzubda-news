# Alzubda News

This project is separated with individual module and most of each folder in `alzubda-news` are represented as the modules.

In each module -

-   There are three sectors of storyboard,viewController and service.
-   `Storyboard` with UIKit are used to present the UIViews.
-   UIViews that presented with UIKit programmatically are included in `viewController`
-   `service` provides the necessary methods, protocols and networks api for some actions or logics of both `Storyboard` and `viewController`

I currently use `viewController` in presentation of UIViews. You can change to `Storyboard` by uncommenting the code.
